            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Technical blogging is a great way to share your expertise while building a potentially valuable readership. 
                It can help you to document projects, or provide guidance to other web users.
                 You can also monetize your content, or use your blog to market your services.</p>
            <p>While technical blogs have the same general characteristics as non-technical blogs, 
                refining your blogging technique will help to make the technical content of your blogs more accessible.</p>

        <div id="structure">
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>When it comes to structure, the same rules apply to technical blogging as they do with non-technical blogging.</p>
            <p>The goal of your structure should be to make the information easy to scan, and easy to digest.</p>
            <p>We know that readers look at web pages in predictable patterns; their gaze follows an ‘F’ shape on the screen. 
                First, they scan the top line and then track down the left-hand side. 
                They will then scan across the center, looking for relevant information.
                A clear structure — with plenty of white space — is very important when you’re writing about a technical subject.
                If you cram lots of detail into every paragraph, your reader will quickly become fatigued. The principle of adding white space 
                applies to technical blogging as it does to paper documentation.</p>
            <p>Each time you begin a new post, try to follow a conventional structure that readers find easy to scan. You should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An introduction, which frames the piece and explains what’s to come. 
                    It usually makes sense to write the introduction after you’ve written the body copy.</li>
                <li>Use a logical heading structure, and ensure your CSS is formatting the headings appropriately.</li>
                <li>Use numbers for procedures or a set number of list items. Use unordered lists for everything else.</li>
                <li>Incorporate placeholders for relevant images, graphs, or infographics. Aim to have some kind of visual element every 500 words.</li>
                <li>End with a conclusion, which sums up the information you’ve presented, or invites questions on the blog. Don’t leave the reader hanging.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
